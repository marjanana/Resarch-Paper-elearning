Sources are generally divided into three groups:<p><b>Primary sources</b> document original ideas, events, and empirical research. They include documents or physical objects created during the time under study: diaries, speeches, manuscripts, letters, interviews, news, film footage, autobiographies, official records; poetry, drama, novels, music, paintings, sculpture, drawings; pottery, furniture, clothing, buildings, coins…<p><b>Secondary sources</b> analyze, review, or summarize information in primary resources or other secondary resources (writings interpreting primary sources: textbooks, magazine articles, histories, criticisms, commentaries, encyclopedias…).<p><b>Tertiary sources</b>, such as encyclopedias synthesize information gathered from other resources.<p>An author cites to give credit to a researcher/s whose ideas they use; to protect themselves from a charge of plagiarism; and to assure readers about the accuracy of facts used. Every time one quotes an author or paraphrases someone’s idea, they need to cite.<p><b>The Chicago Bibliography Citation Style (CMOS)</b>, often used in the humanities, helps researchers acknowledge sources they have used to gather facts and information for their research. In this course, notes and bibliography style will be used.</p><br><hr><p>For more information, visit:<br><br>Guptill, Amy. “Listening to Sources, Talking to Sources.” In <i>Writing in College: From Competence to Excellence.</i> College at Brockport, SUNY: Open SUNY Textbooks.
